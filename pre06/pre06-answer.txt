Exercise 1

1. Draw a table that shows the value of the variables i and n during the execution of loop. The table should contain one column for each variable and one line for each iteration.

i n
10 10
5 10
6 10
3 10
4 10
2 10

2. What is the output of this program?

10
5
6
3
4
2

3. Can you prove that this loop terminates for any positive value of n?

i will always become an even number for any positive value of n, making this loop terminate.
